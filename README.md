# PearBudget Junior

I'm just recording some steps in the setup of a very basic app. It's all public. If you see bugs in the code, please let me know.


## Process

- at Github, create new app, "pbjr"

- in Terminal:
$ rails new pbjr
$ cd pbjr
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -am "First commit. Added Rails app."
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:charliepark/pbjr.git
$ git push origin master
$ touch README.md
$ rm README




### TODO

- set up authentication ... Facebook? Twitter? Devise?
  - let's try Facebook, as more have it
